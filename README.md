# TinyEMU

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fernandotcl/TinyEMU.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fernandotcl/TinyEMU)

This is a port of [TinyEMU][tinyemu] to macOS.

[tinyemu]: https://bellard.org/tinyemu/

## Features

- 32/64/128 bit RISC-V emulation.
- VirtIO console, network, block device, input and 9P filesystem.
- Framebuffer emulation through SDL.
- Remote HTTP block device and filesystem.
- Small code, easy to modify, no external dependencies.

## Usage

Use the VM images available from Fabrice Bellard's [jslinux][] (no need to download them):

```
$ temu https://bellard.org/jslinux/buildroot-riscv64.cfg

Welcome to JS/Linux (riscv64)

Use 'vflogin username' to connect to your account.
You can create a new account at https://vfsync.org/signup .
Use 'export_file filename' to export a file to your computer.
Imported files are written to the home directory.

[root@localhost ~]# uname -a
Linux localhost 4.15.0-00049-ga3b1e7a-dirty #11 Thu Nov 8 20:30:26 CET 2018 riscv64 GNU/Linux
[root@localhost ~]#
```

Use `C-a x` to exit the emulator.

You can also use TinyEMU with local configuration and disks. You can find more information in Fabrice Bellard's [documentation for TinyEMU][tinyemu-readme].
